# Java Conditional Statements.

In Java programming, conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions. There are mainly three types of conditional statements in Java: `if`, `else if`, and `else`.

## 1. `if` Statement

The `if` statement checks a condition and executes a block of code if the condition is true.

### Syntax:
```java
if (condition) {
    // Code to be executed if condition is true
}

## 2. `else if` Statement

The `else if` statement allows you to check multiple conditions after the initial `if` statement. If the first `if` condition is false, it evaluates the next condition.

### Syntax:
```java
else if (condition) {
    // Code to be executed if condition is true
}

## 3. `else` Statement

The `else` statement is used to execute a block of code if none of the preceding conditions are true.

### Syntax:
```java
else {
    // Code to be executed if no condition is true
}
